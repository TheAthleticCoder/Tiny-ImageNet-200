# Tiny-ImageNet-200
Code for getting above 50% validation and test accuracy. The Dataset used is Image-Detect which is a smaller version of the original Tiny-Imagenet-200 datatset (http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip). The smaller dataset has 450 image folders per class instead of 500. There is a chance of getting a higher validation accuracy since having lot of training data can help reduce overfitting, but not the other way round.
